I've been doing a lot of interval training during my current [weight loss
cycle](http://capultra.com/body-weight/). Initially I was doing 100m sprints
but that became less appealing as the weather got colder.  
  
I watched [Dr Michael Mosley](https://twitter.com/DrMichaelMosley)'s "[The
Truth about Exercise](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cywtq)" and it
reminded me that sprints can also be done indoors. The High Intensity Interval
Training (HIIT) plan that Dr Mosley examines in the documentary comprises of 3
x 20s sprints on an exercise bike with a minute of active rest between sets,
so I decided to try it out on the spin bikes at my gym.

The theory behind HIIT is that short, intense exercise employs a higher
percentage of muscle tissue and depletes their glycogen stores. The exhausted
muscles create an "energy sink" that triggers the body to release its stored
fat to replenish the spent glycogen in the muscles.

The burn is unbelievable. By the third sprint my muscles are screaming for
mercy, I'm out of breath and exhausted, and my legs are wobbly to the point
that walking can be a challenge. And yet I don't break a sweat.

The total workout is only about 5 minutes, which seems ridiculously inadequate
compared to the oft-recommended "20-minutes of cardio three times a week"
dogma but I feel that it has been very effective. My bodyfat has decreased
noticeably, and my VO2 max has improved to the point that I can do five
sprints instead of three on my non-lifting days.

Besides, who can't spare 5 minutes a few times a week?
