<p>This week was much tougher than last week.  It was going ok until Thursday when I started to feel really run down and tired, and I actually thought I might be coming down with something.  In fact, I went to bed at 8:30pm on Thursday night.</p>
<p>I also had some niggling muscular pain in my right hip so on Friday, considering the way I was feeling on Thursday, I decided to drive to the gym instead of running and I was feeling a bit better for most of the day, but then I was struck with a pretty serious case of The Grumpies on Saturday.</p>
<p>My total weight loss for the week was about 1lb which is about where I expected it to be, but it felt like I had to work a lot harder for that 1lb than I did for the 6lb last week. I hope my demeanor improves next week, but somehow I get the sense that the moodiness might continue for the duration of the diet.</p>
