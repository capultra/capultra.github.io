<p>I used energy gels extensively when I was training for my first marathon back on 2005.  I sucked one down every 45 minutes on my long runs, as directed on the packaging, and it definitely helped.</p>
<p>I never really thought much about their ingredients; all that mattered was that it helped me get to the next level of endurance running.</p>
<p>I'm a little older, and a little wiser now, and have started paying attention to just about everything that I put into my body, even those little 100-calorie energy gels.  On closer examination, they came up lacking.</p>
<p>They're basically just sugar and salt, and maybe some caffeine.</p>
<p>Take a look at the primary carbohydrate sources in the top brands</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http:/&#47;www.clifbar.com&#47;food&#47;products_shot_gel&#47;">Cliff shots<&#47;a>: Maltodextrin<&#47;li>
<li><a href="https:/&#47;guenergy.com&#47;products&#47;products-energy-gels&#47;">Gu<&#47;a>: Maltodextrin, Fructose<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:/&#47;www.carbboom.com&#47;Clients&#47;Carbboom&#47;CBcms.nsf&#47;content&#47;energy_gel">Carb Boom!<&#47;a>: Maltodextrin<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:/&#47;www.powerbar.ca&#47;products&#47;36&#47;powerbar-energy-gel-green-apple.aspx">PowerBar Energy Gels<&#47;a>: Maltodextrin, Fructose<&#47;li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>The <a href="http:/&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Maltodextrin">Wikipedia article on Maltodextrin<&#47;a> should be enough to convince anyone that maltodextrin is not food. It's a food-like substance, predominantly made from highly processed corn.</p>
<p>Maltodextrin has a <a href="http:/&#47;www.glycemicindex-advice.com&#47;Maltodextrin-and-the-Glycemic-Index.html">Glycemic Index<&#47;a> that's off the charts. It's higher than sugar, resulting in a huge insulin spike and, a short time later, an energy crash so you <i>need<&#47;i> to take one every 45 minutes if you want to keep running.</p>
<p>Some gels also use <a href="http:/&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Brown_rice_syrup">brown rice syrup<&#47;a>.  I used to read the labels on those gels and think, "Cool. Brown rice is good for you, so these gels must be better than the others". Nope, brown rice syrup is just another highly-processed carbohydrate with a Glycemic Index higher than sugar.</p>
<p>So these days I take real food on my long runs.  I pack my <a href="http:/&#47;www.littlegreenpouch.com&#47;">little green pouches<&#47;a> with a salty, sweet potato mash, or mashed bananas, and I can run for hours without the need to "take a hit" every 45 minutes. </p>
<p>Try it yourself and you might be pleasantly surprised.  Wean yourself off the sugar.  Truth be told, any wet carbohydrate source can be easily consumed on-the-go and will keep you strong and healthy while running.</p>
