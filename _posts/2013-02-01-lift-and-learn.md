Lifting taught me two lessons today.

My logbook said that my previous lift on the Incline Bench was 150lb (that's
105lb on the bar), and today I decided to go for 155lb so I put a 45, a 10 and
a 5 on each side.

I unracked and pushed out 3 reps, but it felt really heavy and the last rep
was very slow. A little confused, I checked the weight and realised that I'd
loaded 120lb on the bar for a 165lb lift.

Fucking idiot! I could have got stuck under the bar and really hurt myself, or
worse...

But I didn't. I got lucky.

I learnt two valuable lessons today.

  1. _Always_ double-check the weight.
  2. I can push myself harder.
