Fasting has been getting a lot of buzz in the fitness industry lately. It is
great for fat loss and is associated with many [health
benefits](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/health-benefits-of-intermittent-
fasting/) including increased longevity and improved insulin sensitivity.
However, it's often met with derision by friends and family. Try explaining to
a four-year-old why you're not having breakfast.

I followed [Martin Berkhan](http://leangains.com)'s intermittent fasting
protocol for about 9 months, with an 8-hour eating window between 12pm and
8pm. I did my workouts around 5.30am and took BCAAs until my first meal at
12pm.

The adjustment period took longer than advertised - my body was used to
consuming a large breakfast and a mid-morning snack so fasting until lunch
time was a little challenging. I usually felt "out of it" until I ate, but
that subsided after about six weeks and I found it to be easy after that on
most days.

By far the greatest benefit of 16/8 fasting was its effectiveness at keeping
my body fat down around 10%. I still ate clean food (well, mostly) during my
8-hour feeding window but <del>binge</del> cheat days didn't seem to matter a
whole lot.

I did find it difficult to build muscle on a 16/8 fasting protocol, most
likely because 8 hours just isn't enough time to eat sufficient calories. This
was exacerbated if I started doing any sort of aerobic activity like running.

My calorie requirements are going through the roof now that I've started
training for an ultramarathon so I need to switch up my eating patterns to
ensure that I'm getting enough food at the appropriate time. It would be ill-
advised to attempt a 25 mile (40km) run without eating during or afterwards.

[Brad Pilon](http://bradpilon.com)'s [Eat Stop Eat](http://eatstopeat.com)
intermittent fasting lifestyle is more appropriate for my level of activity.
Brad recommends one or two 24-hour fasts each week, so I'll be able to eat
appropriately for my workouts, but can still reap the health benefits of
fasting by taking a break once or twice a week on the days where it makes the
most sense.
