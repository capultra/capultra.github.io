<p>In January I wrote down a few goals that I wanted to reach this year.  Among them were my lifting goals of 225lb bench press, 225lb squat, 315lb deadlift.</p>
<p>Today I pulled 315lb for 3 reps on the deadlift, and 225lb for 5 reps in the squat.  Unfortunately my bench press is lagging way back at 185lb but I'm hoping that I'll get it to 200lb by the end of the year.</p>
<p>As Meatloaf would say, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=k5hWWe-ts2s">2 out of 3 ain't bad<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>At a bodyweight of 158.5lb, I reckon those numbers aren't bad.  Comparing them to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.exrx.net&#47;Testing&#47;WeightLifting&#47;StrengthStandards.htm">Strength Standards<&#47;a> puts me firmly in the intermediate range which is about right since I've only been lifting since mid-2011.  I was surprised to see that it's my squat, not my bench, that is lagging according to Strength Standards - it should be around 250lb.  </p>
<p>I'm excited to see how much I can push beyond these goals by the end of the year.</p>
