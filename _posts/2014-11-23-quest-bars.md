I love [Quest Bars](http://www.questnutrition.com/protein-bars/). They are delicious, chewy, and high in protein.  I particularly loved the Chocolate Brownie flavour. In fact, I used to eat one or two a day as a way to get in some extra protien _and_ satisfy my chocolate cravings.  I did that for a few months and then I started getting chest pains.

At first, I thought the chest pains were caused stress from work because that is what if felt like - kinda shortness of breath combined with tension in the chest, particularly on the left side. So I dialled back my workload for a few weeks and started listening to relaxation/meditation stuff on my way to and from the office but nothing changed.

So I started thinking back to what I had changed recently that may be causing it.  I generally eat a pretty clean diet, but I had started eating Quest Bars a few months previously.  The ingredients looked ok (Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate, Milk Protein Isolate), Isomalto-Oligosaccharides* (Prebiotic Fiber) Almonds, Cocoa, Water) so it did not occur to me that they could be the problem, but on a whim I decided to cut them out for a week to see what happened.  The chest pain disappeared after a few days.

I was surprised.  So, being a person of scientific persuasian like [this guy](http://xkcd.com/242/), I tried it again. I ate two Quest Bars about 24 hours apart, and about 6 hours after the second bar the chest pain came back.  It lasted for 36-48 hours then disappeared again.  I have repeated this a few times so I am certain that it is the Quest Bars are to blame.

Isomalto-Oligosaccharides was the only item on the ingredient list that concerned me.  According to the [Quest Nutrition website](http://blog.questnutrition.com/what-is-isomalto-oligosaccharide/), Isomalto-Oligosaccharides are good for you. Even the Government of Canada has [no objection to consuming 30g/day](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/appro/isomalto-oligosaccharide-eng.php). Each Quest Bar has about 17g which makes my intake of my 2 bars/day just in excess of the Government's recommendation, but 2g is splitting hairs.  There's also no warning on the box or the label that suggests limiting consumption in any way.

I have not found any other information about Quest Bars causing chest pain.  Even the suspicious-sounding Isomalto-Oligosaccharides comes up clean on that front. There was [a lot of discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2bkthp/quest_bars_too_good_to_be_true/) around whether it is truly fibre, or how much impact it has on blood-glucose levels, but no references to chest pain.

I'd love to hear from anyone else that has experienced similar symptoms.
