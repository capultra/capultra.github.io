In my local grocery store I have two choices for spinach both of which force me to choose between either health or environmental protection.  I can either buy ...

- Organic spinach in a plastic container, or
- Conventional spinach, bunched with an elastic band

This presents a conundrum. I don't want the plastic because it's bad for the environment, but I want to buy the organic spinach because it's better for my health.

Next on my shopping list is eggs.  Same deal

- Organic, free run eggs in a plastic container
- Conventional eggs in a cardboard container

I don't like having to pick one of my values to compromise: my health, and environmental protection. I want to buy organic spinach bundled in an elastic band, and my organic eggs in a cardboard container. Is that too much to ask?
