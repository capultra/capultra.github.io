An article on The Greatist by [JC Deen](www.jcdfitness.com/) titled "[common
workout mistakes](http://greatist.com/fitness/fix-common-workout-mistakes/)"
lists combining cardio and strength training as a mistake.

This is incorrect according to [this
study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7752872) done at the University of
Wisconsin - Madison. In fact, they found that combining endurance training and
strength training _in the same session_ yielded the benefits of both.

The subjects showed improved strength similar to those that did only strength
training, and improved endurance similar to those that did only cardio.

It's worth noting that the session had to be combined. i.e. the subjects did 3
sesions per week, and each training session included an hour of weights and an
hour of cardio. Splitting the 3 sessions into 6 (3 x strength, 3 x cardio)
does _not_ get the same results.

Time to start running to and from the gym.
