One month after suffering a grade 3 AC joint separation I am definitely on the
road to recovery, but still a long way short of back to "normal".

I've been doing my resistance-band exercises plus the Plank exercise each day
for a few weeks now and the strength is slowly returning. I haven't gone back
to the gym yet but I think I'm only a few days away.

Tonight I was able to do a few push-ups which made me feel really good.  I
have been able to do 15 "countertop" push-ups for about a week, but I have to
do most push actions extremely slowly to control any movement in the AC joint,
and by slowly I mean 5 seconds up, 5 seconds down.
