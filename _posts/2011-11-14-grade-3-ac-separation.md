On November 14, 2011 I was hit by a car while cycling to work.  My performance
in the collision resembled that of a Hollywood stuntman in his prime -
airborne, crashed onto the hood, airborne again, slammed into a parked car,
and finally came to rest on the road.  The result was a grade 3 AC separation
in my shoulder.

I was wearing a helmet which now bears a 2-inch crack, but at least that crack
was in the helmet and not in my skull.

The next day the swelling was quite impressive and I had very limited
movement, and movement was very painful. I'm told my left shoulder will have a
permanent bump.

I've spent the last 4 months training for a half-marathon on December 4th in
Las Vegas.  The timing of this accident couldn't have been worse but I decided
to view this as a challenge to be overcome rather than an excuse to pull out.

So ... I have three weeks to get as much rehabilitation done to allow me to
get to the starting line.

My training schedule for the last 4 months has consisted of 2 runs per week (1
x hills, 1 x distance) and 2 weights sessions per week.  Before the accident
my strength was:

  * Bench press: 155lb
  * Deadlift: 205lb
  * Squat: 205lb
  
  
My long distance pace was around 4:50 per kilometre, and my best time over
21.1km was 1:42.  I hope to be able to beat that on race day.

Now, onto the rehab.

For the first week I did nothing but apply ice for 15 minutes, twice a day.  I
had to get the swelling under control before I could do anything.

1 week after the accident I saw a multi-disciplined sports injury specialist
who treated me with Active Release Therapy, Chiropractic, and acupuncture.  I
had treatments on Monday and Wednesday (today).  On Friday I'll meet with a
physiotherapist who will tape my shoulder at the end of the session so that I
can attempt my first run in almost 2 weeks.

Tonight at home I did some isometric exercises followed by a few basic
movements with an unloaded barbell.

I'm pretty happy with my recovery to date.  I can now raise my arm above my
head and out to the side, but reaching across my body to touch the opposite
shoulder is still very painful.  I cannot do a push-up or any bench press
movement, but I can do shoulder presses, Yates rows, squats and deadlifts all
with an empty barbell.  Dips are out of the question.

I am determined to get back to my pre-accident form as quickly as possible but
I'm not prepared to risk a permanent injury to get there. That goes for race
day, too.  I have every intention of running the half-marathon but if my
shoulder becomes too painful I'm not too proud to pull out and log a DNF.
