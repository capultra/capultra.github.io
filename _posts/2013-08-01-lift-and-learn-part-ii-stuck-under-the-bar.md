On Monday, I had a humbling experience - I got stuck under the bar on the
bench press. I workout in the early morning so there aren't usually a lot of
people around, but fortunately one of the other pre-dawn regulars jumped in
and helped out.

I got off lightly; my pride is the only thing that was injured.

I am currently working through a version of The Texas Method which involves
varying volume and intensity throughout the week, with a personal record (PR)
attempt on Friday. I had decided that I'd go for 5 rep max's rather than 1RM
but I got into trouble on the 3rd rep. A part of me thinks I shouldn't have
attempted the 3rd rep, but on the other hand I know that the only way to
progress is to relentlessly push forward.

The failure has really got me thinking about how to _safely_ increase my bench
press. My bench is my weakest lift, and the one that progresses the slowest
and, to be honest, increasing the weight scares me. That thought alone has
probably held me back.

The only factor that seems to be consistent over the years is that my bench is
best when my bodyweight is the highest. For example, I was able to bench 180lb
when my bodyweight was at 165lb, whereas this morning I got stuck under 175lb
at a bodyweight of 155lb. I guess if you're measuring in terms of bodyweight
then it was actually a PR - 109% (180/165) vs 113% (175/155).

Perhaps that's how I should be measuring my progress across all lifts - as a
percentage of bodyweight. If I'd done that on Monday then I would probably
only have attempted 170lb and may have avoided the whole incident.

From now on I'll follow the StrongLifts [guide to bench pressing safely when
you're training alone](http://stronglifts.com/how-to-bench-press-safely-when-
youre-alone/). I'll get a spotter if there's someone around, otherwise I'll
bench in the power rack.

Lift and learn, I guess.
