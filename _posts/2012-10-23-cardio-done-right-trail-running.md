If your cardio workout is [long](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/chronic-
cardio/#axzz29vyC0aee) and [boring](http://www.ttfatloss.com/workouts/), then
maybe you're just not doing it right.

Let me guess, you're probably running or cycling _on a machine in the gym_.
Yeah, that's boring. Maybe you're running along the streets in your
neighbourhood. Slightly better, but still dull.

Try trail running.

I find I can run for hours on a trail - it's long and _exciting_. I can feel
the anticipation building as soon as I decide I'm going to run some trails.

Apart from the scenery, I have found that my injury rate is almost nonexistent
since I started trail running, and I think this is mostly because I'm not
running in a straight line with the exact same stride on hard pavement for
hours on end.

When you run on trails, the surface is constantly changing forcing changes in
your gait. Sometimes you're stepping sideways to avoid a rock; or taking many
small steps through some exposed tree roots; or clambering up a rocky
hillside. These gait variations all help to strengthen the little muscles in
your feet and legs making them less susceptible to injury.

For me it's not always possible to run on the trails. I live in an urban area
of Toronto where the weather puts an end to trail running around October, but
I find that the benefits I get from trail running during the warmer months
last me throughout the year. By the time Spring rolls around I'm itching to
get my feet dirty again.
