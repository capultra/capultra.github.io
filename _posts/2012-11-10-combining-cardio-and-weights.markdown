<p>An article on The Greatist by <a href="www.jcdfitness.com&#47;">JC Deen<&#47;a> titled "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;greatist.com&#47;fitness&#47;fix-common-workout-mistakes&#47;">common workout mistakes<&#47;a>" lists combining cardio and strength training as a mistake.</p>
<p>This is incorrect according to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#47;pubmed&#47;7752872">this study<&#47;a> done at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  In fact, they found that combining endurance training and strength training <i>in the same session<&#47;i> yielded the benefits of both.</p>
<p>The subjects showed improved strength similar to those that did only strength training, and improved endurance similar to those that did only cardio.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the session had to be combined.  i.e. the subjects did 3 sesions per week, and each training session included an hour of weights and an hour of cardio.  Splitting the 3 sessions into 6 (3 x strength, 3 x cardio) does <i>not<&#47;i> get the same results.</p>
<p>Time to start running to and from the gym.</p>
