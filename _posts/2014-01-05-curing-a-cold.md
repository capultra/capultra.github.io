<p>I had a bad cold for 7 days and it made me miserable.  It morphed from blocked nose, to runny nose and sneezing, to dry cough, to hacking cough etc.</p>
<p>On the 7th day  I'd had enough and decided to 'go herbal' in a last-ditch effort to kill the thing.  I made two separate batches of this god-awful witch's brew and drank it throughout the day, and now on day 8 the cold is basically gone.</p>
<p>It could be argued that it was going to clear up anyway, but I'd spent the last 4 days believing that each day would be the final day of the illness only to awake the following day and still feel like shit.  So, try it if you like. Your results may vary.</p>
<p>I based my recipe on <a href="http:/&#47;www.chatelaine.com&#47;health&#47;wellness&#47;flu-fighting-tea&#47;">this one<&#47;a> by Tara Miller.</p>
<p>Mine was:</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>3 cups of water</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp cinnamon</li>
<li>3 slices (1/4 inch thick) of fresh ginger<&#47;li>
<li>&frac14; tsp cloves</li>
<li>&frac12; tbsp turmeric (yes, tablespoon)</li>
<li>&frac12; tsp paprika</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
<li>3 bags green tea</li><br />
</ul><br />
Directions</p>
<ol>
<li>Add all ingredients to a pot and bring to a boil.</li>
<li>Once boiling reduce heat and let simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Pour tea through a strainer and drink while warm.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<p>I also consumed 2x1L batches of my infamous green smoothie<br />
Ingredients</p>
<ul>
<li>1 apple</li>
<li>&frac12; cucumber</li>
<li>Lots of kale</li>
<li>Handful of parsley</li>
<li>1 scoop pea protein</li>
<li>500ml water</li><br />
</ul><br />
Directions</p>
<ol>
<li>Add all items to blender</li>
<li>Blend until smooth</li><br />
</ol></p>
