I recently watched two interesting documentaries/instructional films about
bodybuilding. Now, I'm certainly no bodybuilder but I feel that there's a lot
that I can learn from the bodybuilding community.

The first was [Layne Norton's](http://www.biolayne.com/)
[UNLEASHED](http://www.amazon.com/Layne-Norton-Unleashed/dp/B002T4KXG6), and
the other was [Ronnie Coleman's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Coleman)
[The Cost of Redemption](http://www.amazon.com/Ronnie-Coleman-The-Cost-
Redemption/dp/B000B6KRCE).

Layne Norton was eloquent, educated and entertaining to watch. He takes a
science-based approach to his diet and workouts, and he appears healthy,
strong and vibrant. At the end of the film I was convinced that I should try
some variant of his Power/Hypertrophy workout at some point in the future and
I particularly liked his approach to bulking which includes a short cut cycle
every few weeks paired with a whole-food diet.

In contrast, I only made it through about 10 minutes of Ronnie Coleman's film
before turning it off. Ronnie looked tired, lethargic and unhealthy despite
being an 8-time Mr Olympia. The film opens with him making a breakfast of
Grits n' Cheese from a packet cooked in the microwave, then mixed with a small
pail of egg whites and consumed on the couch in front of the T.V.

Which of these two men would you model yourself after?

Choosing an appropriate role model is about focusing on more than just one
single aspect of that person's life. You may want to look like Ronnie Coleman
and win 8 Mr Olympia titles, but is it really worth the long-term cost to your
health and comfort? Not for me.
