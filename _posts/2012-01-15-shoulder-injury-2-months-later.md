It has now been 2 months since my shoulder injury (a grade 3 AC joint
separation).

I am pleased with the progress that I've made to date, but was expecting the
pain to have subsided more than it has.  
  
**The Good**  
I can now do 15 pushups. My squat and deadlift are back to their pre-injury
weights, and my bent-over row is improving. Last week I was able to pick up my
35 lb pre-schooler for the first time.

Getting dressed is not painful any more, and I can sleep on my bad side but it
does make it stiff the next day.

**The Bad**  
Sudden movements are still very painful (and frequent when there's a 3 year-
old to chase after). The other day I slipped on the ice and my arms flailed;
the pain nearly brought me to tears.

Dips, pull-ups and chin-ups are still impossible, and I haven't attempted a
bench press yet. I can only manage 95lb on the incline bench.

**Looking forward**  
Once I am able to do 40 push-ups then I'll introduce the flat bench into my
workout. I'd also like to incorporate a shoulder press pretty soon - pushing
overhead is easier than pulling.
