<p>Here's a <a href="http:/&#47;capultra.com&#47;body-weight&#47;" title="Body weight">chart tracking my current weight<&#47;a>.  My starting weight is 166lb.</p>
<p>To kick-off my fat loss cycle I'll be doing a 24h fast today (Saturday), and then my plan for the next 5 weeks will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mon</b>: Upper body workout<&#47;li>
<li><b>Tues</b>: 24h fasting day plus sprint workout<&#47;li>
<li><b>Wed</b>: Lower body workout<&#47;li>
<li><b>Thurs</b>: 24h fasting day plus sprint workout<&#47;li>
<li><b>Fri</b>: Upper body workout<&#47;li>
<li><b>Sat</b>: Rest<&#47;li>
<li><b>Sun</b>: Rest<&#47;li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>On my fasting days, I'll eat a light dinner around 6:30pm.  If I get too hungry then I'll have some raw celery and carrots on hand to snack on.  Other than that it'll just be green tea, water and black decaf coffee.</p>
<p>The sprint workouts will be a short 1km warm-up followed by several 100-400m sprints, then a 1km cool-down.  I expect it'll only take 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The weight sessions will be the same as they were during my growth cycle.<br />
Upper body: Bench Press, T-Bar Row, Shoulder Press, Lat Pull-down<br />
Lower body: Squats, Deadlifts</p>
<p>I'll see how this goes next week and make any adjustments if necessary.</p>
<p><b><i>Update</i><&#47;b><br />
Here are the <i>actuals</i> from my first week.<br />
My weight went from 166lb to 161lb for a total weight loss of 5lb.  Being the first week I expected a big drop but I'm sure a significant proportion of that was water.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sat</b>: 24h fast. Sprint workout<&#47;li>
<li><b>Sun</b>: Rest<&#47;li>
<li><b>Mon</b>: Upper body workout. Run to and from gym<&#47;li>
<li><b>Tues</b>: Rest<&#47;li>
<li><b>Wed</b>: Lower body workout. Run to and from gym<&#47;li>
<li><b>Thurs</b>: Rest<&#47;li>
<li><b>Fri</b>: Upper body workout. Run to and from gym<&#47;li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>This schedule fits better with my lifestyle and I'll probably stick to it for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>It's exactly 4km from my house to the gym so I'm running 8km each workout day, and I try to cover the distance as fast as I can.  My time improved dramatically throughout the week, going from 21 minutes on Monday to 19 minutes on Friday, but I'd like to see it around 16 minutes by the end of this cycle.</p>
