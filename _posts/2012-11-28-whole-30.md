I just heard about the [Whole 30](http://whole9life.com/2012/08/the-
whole30-program/) program, and love the approach that this diet recommends. I
particularly love its zero-tolerance for cheating in any form.

> **It is not hard.** Don't you _dare_ tell us this is hard. Quitting heroin
is hard. Beating cancer is hard. Drinking your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard.

This is awesome. Man up and get some perspective on your diet.

> Don't even consider the possibility of a "slip". Unless you physically
tripped and your face landed in a box of doughnuts, there is no "slip". You
make a choice to eat something unhealthy. It is always a choice, so do not
phrase it as if you had an accident...

This resonates so deeply for me. Every item you put in your mouth represents a
choice. Take responsibility!

> You never, ever, ever HAVE to eat anything you don't want to eat

If there's nothing available that suits your diet then just skip that meal.
Our ancestors didn't eat 3 squares a day, they ate when food was available.
You're not going to die if you skip a meal or two.
