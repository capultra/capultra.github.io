<p>The last marathon I ran was the <a href="http:/&#47;torontomarathon.com&#47;">Toronto marathon<&#47;a> in 2005, and I finished in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sportstats.ca&#47;searchResults.xhtml?month=0&lastname=pardey&year=&firstname=craig&city=toronto">3:57:36<&#47;a>.  I was shooting for a sub-4 so I was pretty stoked with that time.</p>
<p>Now, nearly 8 years later I'm excited to be running it again, but I've done a lot of things differently this time.</p>
<p>I've been running less. A lot less - only once per week.  Last time I was training about 5 days a week and it really felt like a grind towards the end.  The ramp-up was too fast, and I had several injuries throughout the training program including my knee and lower back.  So this time around I decided to mix strength training and running so I've been lifting weights 3 times a week concentrating on the big compound movements, and running my long distances on the weekends.  I have been virtually injury free and have not really felt like the runs were a grind - even those bitterly-cold pre-dawn winter runs.</p>
<p>I'm running "barefoot". Well, in Vibram FiveFingers, anyway.  I started transitioning to a minimalist running style during my preparations for the Las Vegas Half back in Dec 2011 and ramped up slowly over about 6 months.  Now, I couldn't imagine going back to regular shoes - they just feel so confining.</p>
<p>I'm also carb-loading this time.  I dropped 7lb in 10 days on a low-carb diet (mostly water weight), did a short tempo run on Wednesday morning, and now I'll be carb-loading <a href="http:/&#47;greatist.com&#47;fitness&#47;does-carb-loading-really-work">like this<&#47;a> for the next 3 days.  Hopefully it will make the later stages of the race a little easier.</p>
<p>As usual I have three goal times for the race</p>
<ol>
<li>Sub 3:45 would be awesome</li>
<li>Sub 3:55 would be good</li>
<li>Sub 4:00 would be satisfactory</li><br />
</ol><br />
Mostly, I'm interested to see if "less is more" when it comes to training.</p>
