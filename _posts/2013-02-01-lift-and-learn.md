<p>Lifting taught me two lessons today.</p>
<p>My logbook said that my previous lift on the Incline Bench was 150lb (that's 105lb on the bar), and today I decided to go for 155lb so I put a 45, a 10 and a 5 on each side.</p>
<p>I unracked and pushed out 3 reps, but it felt really heavy and the last rep was very slow. A little confused, I checked the weight and realised that I'd loaded 120lb on the bar for a 165lb lift. </p>
<p>Fucking idiot! I could have got stuck under the bar and really hurt myself, or worse...</p>
<p>But I didn't. I got lucky.</p>
<p>I learnt two valuable lessons today.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Always</i> double-check the weight.<&#47;li>
<li>I can push myself harder.</li><br />
</ol></p>
