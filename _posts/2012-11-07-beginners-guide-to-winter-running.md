Winter running is awesome.  It's extreme, refreshing, and challenging but you
do need to apply some common sense.

You have to be flexible with your schedule - it's never a good idea to run
during/after a fresh snowfall because you have to run so slowly that there's
no workout, so you get cold, and you slip-and-slide into an injury.  It's
kinda fun to do it once or twice though, especially if it's a clear day.

Use warm/hot water in your water bottles to prevent them from freezing. The
spout usually freezes first, but it's easily cleared.  Carry lip balm and a
snot-rag in your pouch/pocket.

Also, being visible is key because it's always dark, so go for a few lighter
colours and maybe something with scotch-brite reflective shit on it.  I've
recently started wearing a headlamp.

Waterproof doesn't matter - you need layers.

Start with

  * A pair of running tights [like these](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/RunningAndFitness/MensClothing/PRD~5027-083/craft-pr-tights-mens.jsp).
  * Basic [gloves](http://ca.shop.runningroom.com/polyester-glove-liner.html)
  * A [lycra balaclava](http://www.amazon.com/illumiNITE-Cold-Weather-Hood-Black/dp/B004VF4S4Y) is a good addition, but you can get away with a $5 fleece beanie
  * Wear 2 shirts - a tight short-sleeve and a long sleeve over it.
  

That'll work down to about -5°C.

Below that, you'll need to add a "real" pair of gloves, a fleece sweater
and/or a thermal long-sleeve base layer, and possibly a [neck-gaiter](http://w
ww.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/MensClothing/Headwear/Winter/PRD~5016-198/mec-algidity-
neckgaitor-unisex.jsp).  A light [windbreaker shell](http://www.mec.ca/AST/Sho
pMEC/MensClothing/OutdoorAthletic/LongSleevedJackets/PRD~5021-508/mec-flux-
jacket-mens.jsp) might also come in handy when there's a wicked wind-chill,
but I've only ever worn mine once or twice (I think it was -25°C with the
wind-chill).

I wear [Yak
Tracks](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Footwear/TractionDevices/PRD~5031-877
/yaktrax-running-ice-traction-device-unisex.jsp) if it's icy or if I'm running
on uncleared rural roads but they're ONLY good on snow and ice.  As soon as
you hit the road they're really uncomfortable and actually slippery.

Don't buy it all at once - you may not need it and the shit's expensive.
Outdoor stores are usually cheaper than running stores, and they have a wider
selection of stuff.
