<p>I recently watched two interesting documentaries&#47;instructional films about bodybuilding.  Now, I'm certainly no bodybuilder but I feel that there's a lot that I can learn from the bodybuilding community.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.biolayne.com&#47;">Layne Norton's<&#47;a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Layne-Norton-Unleashed&#47;dp&#47;B002T4KXG6">UNLEASHED<&#47;a>, and the other was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Ronnie_Coleman">Ronnie Coleman's<&#47;a> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;Ronnie-Coleman-The-Cost-Redemption&#47;dp&#47;B000B6KRCE">The Cost of Redemption<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Layne Norton was eloquent, educated and entertaining to watch.  He takes a science-based approach to his diet and workouts, and he appears healthy, strong and vibrant.  At the end of the film I was convinced that I should try some variant of his Power&#47;Hypertrophy workout at some point in the future and I particularly liked his approach to bulking which includes a short cut cycle every few weeks paired with a whole-food diet.</p>
<p>In contrast, I only made it through about 10 minutes of Ronnie Coleman's film before turning it off.  Ronnie looked tired, lethargic and unhealthy despite being an 8-time Mr Olympia.  The film opens with him making a breakfast of Grits n' Cheese from a packet cooked in the microwave, then mixed with a small pail of egg whites and consumed on the couch in front of the T.V.</p>
<p>Which of these two men would you model yourself after?</p>
<p>Choosing an appropriate role model is about focusing on more than just one single aspect of that person's life.  You may want to look like Ronnie Coleman and win 8 Mr Olympia titles, but is it really worth the long-term cost to your health and comfort?  Not for me.</p>
