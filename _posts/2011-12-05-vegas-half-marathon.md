<p>On December 4, three weeks after getting hit by a car, I ran the Las Vegas half-marathon in 1:44:11.</p>
<p>I was very nervous about how my shoulder would hold up, but it was ok. &nbsp;I had to run with my left elbow held tightly against my ribs to limit movement in the AC joint, and as soon as the race was over I headed to the medical tent for an ice pack to prevent excessive swelling.</p>
<p>The race probably set my recovery back a week or two but I am really glad I was able to complete the race - I don't think I sustained any permanent injury from it.</p>
<p>Now, onto the shoulder rehabilitation.</p>
