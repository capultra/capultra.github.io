It's been a year since I suffered a <a href="index.php?p=26">Grade 3 AC separation</a> in my left shoulder - 3 ligaments in the AC joint were completely torn, never to return.</p>
<p>It put me out of the gym for about 5 weeks, and the shoulder remained weak for a long time.  Looking back through my training log I can see that it took about 5 months for my strength to return for most lifts.</p>
<p>The best advice I received during the recovery phase came from my kinesiologist, "You need to keep the shoulder strong for the rest of your life. That will work better than any surgery."</p>
<p>To minimize movement and clicking in the AC joint I pinch my shoulder blades together and tense my back muscles prior to performing most movements.  It's very effective but it's tiring. However, it's now something I do instinctively and I don't even have to think about it - in fact, I think it enforces good form.</p>
<p>1 year later, my bench press is at 180lb (up 25lb) and my deadlift is 265lb (up 60lb).  Overall, I'm pleased with the progress that I've made.  </p>
<p>The following exercises were most affected by the injury</p>
<ul>
<li>Shoulder press: It was 2 months before I could perform an unloaded bar lift</li>
<li>Lat pull-down: 2.5 months</li>
<li>Bench press: 3 months</li>
<li>Dumbell flyes: 4 months</li>
<li>Dips: > 1 year</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>I had to start from zero with each of these exercises, and I had to work really hard to pinch my shoulder blades and tense up my whole back to avoid any 'clicking' in the shoulder joint.  During the rehab phase I would stop any exercise at the first click.</p>
<p>Incline bench presses were much easier on the AC joint than the flat bench - I was able to perform incline presses only 5 weeks after the injury but I still had to start with an unloaded bar.</p>
<p>I was able to deadlift after 5 weeks without too much discomfort, but I still took it easy.</p>
<p>Dips are by far the most affected exercise. I can <i>kinda</i> do them, but I do not get the full range of motion before I start to feel a lot of stress in the AC joint.  Once my upper arm reaches parallel it feels like the joint would pop out entirely if I went any lower. </p>
