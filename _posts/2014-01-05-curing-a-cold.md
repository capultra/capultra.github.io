I had a bad cold for 7 days and it made me miserable. It morphed from blocked
nose, to runny nose and sneezing, to dry cough, to hacking cough etc.

On the 7th day I'd had enough and decided to 'go herbal' in a last-ditch
effort to kill the thing. I made two separate batches of this god-awful
witch's brew and drank it throughout the day, and now on day 8 the cold is
basically gone.

It could be argued that it was going to clear up anyway, but I'd spent the
last 4 days believing that each day would be the final day of the illness only
to awake the following day and still feel like shit. So, try it if you like.
Your results may vary.

I based my recipe on [this one](http://www.chatelaine.com/health/wellness/flu-
fighting-tea/) by Tara Miller.

Mine was:

Ingredients

  * 3 cups of water
  * ½ tsp cinnamon
  * 3 slices (1/4 inch thick) of fresh ginger
  * ¼ tsp cloves
  * ½ tbsp turmeric (yes, tablespoon)
  * ½ tsp paprika
  * 1 clove of garlic
  * 3 bags green tea
  
  
Directions

  1. Add all ingredients to a pot and bring to a boil.
  2. Once boiling reduce heat and let simmer for about 10 minutes.
  3. Pour tea through a strainer and drink while warm.
  

I also consumed 2x1L batches of my infamous green smoothie  
Ingredients

  * 1 apple
  * ½ cucumber
  * Lots of kale
  * Handful of parsley
  * 1 scoop pea protein
  * 500ml water
  
  
Directions

  1. Add all items to blender
  2. Blend until smooth
