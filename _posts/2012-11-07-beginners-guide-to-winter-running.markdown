<p>Winter running is awesome. &nbsp;It's extreme, refreshing, and challenging but you do need to apply some common sense.</p>
<p>You have to be flexible with your schedule - it's never a good idea to run during&#47;after a fresh snowfall because you have to run so slowly that there's no workout, so you get cold, and you slip-and-slide into an injury. &nbsp;It's kinda fun to do it once or twice though, especially if it's a clear day.</p>
<p>Use warm&#47;hot water in your water bottles to prevent them from freezing. The spout usually freezes first, but it's easily cleared. &nbsp;Carry lip balm&nbsp;and a snot-rag&nbsp;in your pouch&#47;pocket.</p>
<p>Also, being visible is key because it's always dark, so go for a few lighter colours and maybe something with scotch-brite reflective shit on it. &nbsp;I've recently started wearing a headlamp.</p>
<p>Waterproof doesn't matter - you need layers.</p>
<p>Start with</p>
<ul>
<li>A pair of running tights&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mec.ca&#47;AST&#47;ShopMEC&#47;RunningAndFitness&#47;MensClothing&#47;PRD~5027-083&#47;craft-pr-tights-mens.jsp" target="_blank">like these<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li>Basic&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;ca.shop.runningroom.com&#47;polyester-glove-liner.html" target="_blank">gloves<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li>A&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;illumiNITE-Cold-Weather-Hood-Black&#47;dp&#47;B004VF4S4Y" target="_blank">lycra balaclava<&#47;a>&nbsp;is a good addition, but you can get away with a $5 fleece beanie<&#47;li>
<li>Wear 2 shirts - a tight short-sleeve and a long sleeve over it.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>That'll work down to about&nbsp;-5&deg;C.</p>
<p>Below that, you'll need to add a "real" pair of gloves, a fleece sweater and&#47;or a thermal long-sleeve base layer, and possibly a&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mec.ca&#47;AST&#47;ShopMEC&#47;MensClothing&#47;Headwear&#47;Winter&#47;PRD~5016-198&#47;mec-algidity-neckgaitor-unisex.jsp" target="_blank">neck-gaiter<&#47;a>. &nbsp;A light&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mec.ca&#47;AST&#47;ShopMEC&#47;MensClothing&#47;OutdoorAthletic&#47;LongSleevedJackets&#47;PRD~5021-508&#47;mec-flux-jacket-mens.jsp" target="_blank">windbreaker shell<&#47;a>&nbsp;might also come in handy when there's a wicked wind-chill, but I've only ever worn mine once or twice (I think it was -25&deg;C with the wind-chill).</p>
<p>I wear&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mec.ca&#47;AST&#47;ShopMEC&#47;Footwear&#47;TractionDevices&#47;PRD~5031-877&#47;yaktrax-running-ice-traction-device-unisex.jsp" target="_blank">Yak Tracks<&#47;a>&nbsp;if it's icy or if I'm running on uncleared rural roads but they're ONLY good on snow and ice. &nbsp;As soon as you hit the road they're really uncomfortable and actually slippery.</p>
<p>Don't buy it all at once - you may not need it and the shit's expensive. &nbsp;Outdoor stores are usually cheaper than running stores, and they have a wider selection of stuff.</p>
