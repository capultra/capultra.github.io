<p>If your cardio workout is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.marksdailyapple.com&#47;chronic-cardio&#47;#axzz29vyC0aee">long<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ttfatloss.com&#47;workouts&#47;">boring<&#47;a>, then maybe you're just not doing it right.</p>
<p>Let me guess, you're probably running or cycling <i>on a machine in the gym<&#47;i>. Yeah, that's boring.  Maybe you're running along the streets in your neighbourhood.  Slightly better, but still dull.</p>
<p>Try trail running.</p>
<p>I find I can run for hours on a trail - it's long and <i>exciting<&#47;i>.  I can feel the anticipation building as soon as I decide I'm going to run some trails.  </p>
<p>Apart from the scenery, I have found that my injury rate is almost nonexistent since I started trail running, and I think this is mostly because I'm not running in a straight line with the exact same stride on hard pavement for hours on end.  </p>
<p>When you run on trails, the surface is constantly changing forcing changes in your gait.  Sometimes you're stepping sideways to avoid a rock; or taking many small steps through some exposed tree roots; or clambering up a rocky hillside.  These gait variations all help to strengthen the little muscles in your feet and legs making them less susceptible to injury.</p>
<p>For me it's not always possible to run on the trails.  I live in an urban area of Toronto where the weather puts an end to trail running around October, but I find that the benefits I get from trail running during the warmer months last me throughout the year.  By the time Spring rolls around I'm itching to get my feet dirty again.</p>
