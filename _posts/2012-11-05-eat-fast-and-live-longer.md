<p>I just watched an excellent BBC documentary titled <a href="http:/&#47;www.bbc.co.uk&#47;programmes&#47;b01lxyzc">Eat, Fast and Live Longer<&#47;a>.  Michael Mosley investigates the health impact of various forms of Intermittent Fasting including a prolonged 3.5 day fast, alternate day fasting, and 5&#47;2 alternate day fasting.</p>
<p>The science is irrefutable - the health of this 55 year-old man was dramatically improved through short-term fasting.  Lower blood glucose, lower IGF-1, lower body fat etc.  This should significantly reduce his likelihood of developing cancer, heart disease and diabetes.</p>
