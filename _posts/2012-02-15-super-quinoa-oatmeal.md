A while ago I saw a video clip of an Olympic coach preparing "super" oatmeal -
a recipe he invented for his athletes.  I find oatmeal can be a little hard to
digest, so I substituted quinoa and the result was a gluten-free delicacy.

This makes 4-5 servings

Ingredients:

  * 1 cup quinoa
  * 2 cups almond milk
  * 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder
  * 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds
  * 2 tablespoons of chia seeds
  * 2 tablespoons of almond butter
  * 1 tablespoon of cinnamon
  
  

Method:

  * Bring the almond milk and quinoa to the boil
  * Add other ingredients, mixing well.
  * Put on low heat, cover and simmer, stirring frequently or else it'll stick to the bottom
  * Simmer until the liquid is mostly gone and pretty thick - about 10 - 15 minutes
  
  

Serve with a little extra almond milk and a tablespoon or two of maple syrup.

It keeps in the fridge for about 5 - 7 days.
