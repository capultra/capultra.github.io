<p>I started a growth cycle on Oct 1st, three weeks after my epigastric hernia surgery on Sept 13.  The plan was to bulk up for 7 weeks and then do a short 4 week fat-loss cycle before heading home to Australia for Christmas.  I want to be beach-ready when I get there.</p>
<p>Most of the excess calories during the growth cycle came from steel-cut oats.  I was eating about a cup (measured raw) per day, in addition to my regular meals.  I was also fasting on Sundays to minimize fat gain and to reset my insulin sensitivity.  </p>
<p>I lifted heavy on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and did a long run (20-30km) every Saturday.</p>
<p>At the start of the growth cycle I was 5'10" and 154lb, and today (7 weeks later) I'm 166lb.  I can still kinda see my abs but they're pretty blurry so it's time to cut the fat.</p>
<p>I'll be on a fat-loss program for the next 5 weeks.  The plan is</p>
<ul>
<li>Fasting 2-3 times week.<&#47;li>
<li>Sprints twice a week.<&#47;li>
<li>Weights 3 times per week.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
