When it comes to making a change in life, there are two choices:

  1. Commit to specific goals **now**, or
  2. Admit that the goal is not important to you.
  

_You must pick one._

Forcing yourself to choose one determines your dedication to the goal.

For example, a statement like "I want to get fit" needs to be followed
immediately by a set of actionable commitments that will move you towards that
goal. Be specific. "I will run for 15 minutes on Mon, Wed, and Fri at 7pm".

Failure to commit makes Option 2 the default. And you have to say it out loud.
