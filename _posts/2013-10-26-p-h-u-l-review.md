<p>I have just completed 6 weeks of doing a <a href="http:/&#47;www.muscleandstrength.com&#47;workouts&#47;phul-workout">Power Hypertrophy Upper Lower (P.H.U.L.) Workout<&#47;a> and was very pleased with the results.</p>
<p>I'd probably classify myself as an intermediate lifter - I've been lifting consistently for about 3 years and concentrate on strength-based routines grounded in the big compound lifts of squats, deadlifts, bench press and shoulder press.</p>
<p>I started the program in Sept after maintaining a pretty lean weight over the summer, and planned to use P.H.U.L as my first bulking period.  I'm 5'10" tall and 39 years old and on day one I tipped the scales at 162lb.  Today I weighed in at 175lb for a gain of 13lb. Not bad.</p>
<p>The <a href="http:/&#47;www.muscleandstrength.com&#47;workouts&#47;phul-workout">P.H.U.L. Workout<&#47;a> is a 4-day routine which I'd never done before - I generally go for 3-day splits.  I work out at 5.30am when there's very few other people at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;system-fitness.com&#47;">the gym<&#47;a> so I find it hard to get up that early 4 days per week and not feel totally exhausted by Friday.  However, I adjusted pretty well and if anything found that my sleep improved a little due to the more consistent sleep schedule.</p>
<p>I was definitely eating above maintenance, but not excessively.  After staying lean over the summer I think my body was ready to add a few pounds so I gained weight fairly easily.  My six-pack has gone from very defined to barely visible so I'd say at least half my gains were bodyfat.</p>
<p>Overall I really enjoyed the routine.  Each day starts with a compound lift or two and then progresses into more isolated movements as fatigue starts to set in.  By the end of each session I felt totally spent, and experienced what bodybuilders call 'a pump'.  </p>
<p>Initially the workouts took about 45 minutes, and by the end they were taking just under an hour.  I stuck to 90-120 second rests between sets where possible but sometimes extended it to get an extra set in.</p>
<p>I tried to progress each workout by adding either weight, reps, or sets.  I recorded new PRs in all the big lifts, including 260lb squat (+35lb) and 335lb deadlift (+20lb).</p>
<p>The lower body days, particularly the Friday lower hypertrophy day, really got me sweating.  By the end of the Friday workout I was totally spent.  The upper body days were also taxing, but I found they were a little easier probably because the muscle group is smaller than the lower body.</p>
<p>So, what next? I plan to do a <a href="http:/&#47;jasonferruggia.com&#47;how-to-deload-properly-and-why-its-so-important&#47;">deload week<&#47;a> and drop my calories back to maintenance, and then I'll repeat the workout for another 6 weeks.  After that, I might try <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jcdfitness.com&#47;2009&#47;01&#47;lyle-mcdonalds-bulking-routine&#47;">Lyle McDonald's generic bulking routine<&#47;a>.</p>
