This morning I did my first weights workout since my Grade 3 AC joint
separation 5 weeks ago.  I didn't push it hard, the point was to start
building some strength slowly while trying to avoid further injury.  Most of
the weights were around my previous warmup levels. i.e. around 60%.

I was focusing on my legs and back, so the exercises were: Squats, bent-over
rows, seated rows, deadlift, incline press.  I tried doing some lat pulldowns
but there was way too much movement in the AC joint for my comfort.  I was
surprised I was able to deadlift at all but it was quite comfortable.  The
rowing exercises required the most concentration to keep the joint stable, as
did the incline press.

I'll probably stick with this routine three times a week for a month or so,
gradually increasing the weights.  I hope to be back to my pre-injury strength
by the end of January.
