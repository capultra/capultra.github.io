On Friday I paid $85 for my first [Bod Pod](http://www.cosmed.com/bodpodgs)
assessment at [Totum](http://www.totum.ca/services/bod-pod/) in Toronto.

The Bod Pod is one of several techniques for testing body composition (lean
body mass and body fat), and is considered reasonably accurate compared with
the more common tests like calipers and electronic impedance.

My appointment was at 8am, so I had to skip breakfast and drank 2 glasses of
water about 2 hours prior to the test, and I stripped down to a pair of
Speedos for the test.

To take the measurements, I sat in the Bod Pod, while the attendant sealed it
and then the machine pumps little pulses of air pressure into the capsule.
Each measurement took about 30 seconds and the pod is opened between each test
to equalize the pressure. The test comprises of taking the measurements 3
times so the whole test only took about 5 minutes.

I could feel the air pressure changes in my ears but it wasn't uncomfortable.

My results were  
**Weight**: 156.9lb  
**Fat**: 20.1lb (12.8%)  
**Lean Mass**: 136.8lb (87.2%)

This makes my metabolic rate (with a 1.55 activity multiplier)  
Harris-Benedict formula: 2,600 calories/day.  
Katch-McArdle formula: 2,650 calories/day.

Overall I was happy with the results but I had hoped that my bodyfat levels
would be a little lower, so I think I'll will probably continue with the fat
loss cycle until I get to 10%.
