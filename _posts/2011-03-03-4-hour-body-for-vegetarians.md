I've had great success on Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Body "Slow Carb" diet. I lost
about 20lb in a little over a month and have come to really enjoy eating this
way. What surprised me most was that I actually had 20lb to lose. I'm 5'10"
and was 170lb at the start of the diet, and now I'm down to 150lb and can
almost see my abs.

Being vegetarian presented some limitations but overall it was pretty easy.
Here's what my typical day looks like:

**Breakfast**: 1 whole egg, 2 egg whites, scrambled with a good handful of black beans and a load of mixed vegetables  
**Snack**: Lentil soup or Veg Chilli  
**Lunch**: Big-ass Spinach Salad. Seriously - it's so big it's falling off the sides of a regular dinner plate.  
**Snack**: Lentil soup or Veg Chilli  
**Dinner**: Huge veggie stir-fry with beans or lentils.  
**Evening**: Tablespoon of almond/peanut butter. Tablespoon of flax seed oil.

I added a few supplements after 2 weeks: Probiotic, multivitamin, ALA, Garlic,
Green Tea.

I drink copious amounts of water - probably 3 or 4 litres a day. I also drink
3 or 4 cups of green tea per day. I quit coffee at the start of the diet, but
still occasionally have black tea.

I experimented with an ice-pack on the back of the neck/shoulders in the
evening but didn't see any noticeable difference.
