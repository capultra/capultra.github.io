<p>I'm at the beginning of a weight-loss cycle but I'm going to approach it a little differently this time - I'm going to do it gradually.</p>
<p>I got the idea from Layne Norton, a  coach, bodybuilder, powerlifter, with a PhD in nutrition, and I think he mentions his diet strategy in his <a href="http:/&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;v&#47;QHHzie6XRGk">Metabolic Damage<&#47;a> video.</p>
<p>I typically go straight into a fairly extreme low-carb diet which produces great results in a short period of time, but Layne got me thinking that it might not be the most efficient way to lose fat because I'm probably losing more muscle than I need to and wrecking my metabolism too.</p>
<p>So this time I'm taking it slowly.  Instead of giving myself 6 weeks to diet down I'm going to take 10 weeks.  That may seem like prolonging the torture but I'm not dieting hard the whole time.</p>
<p>I started by cutting out sugars and refined carbs.  I don't eat a lot of these anyway but it was enough to get the fat loss started, which is what this progressive strategy is all about - doing just enough to keep the fat loss moving.</p>
<p>Once the fat loss slows, probably after a few weeks, I'll cut a few more calories by dropping other carbs and/or unnecessary fats.  At this point, it's still pretty easy because I'm not starving myself, I'm just cutting out the excess calories.</p>
<p>Once the fat loss slows again then I'll have to further reduce my caloric intake to re-ignite the fat loss.  But I've given myself plenty of time so that I can do it gradually which will help preserve my metabolism and my muscle mass.  </p>
<p>I have confidence that this progressive weight-loss strategy will be both effective and manageable.</p>
