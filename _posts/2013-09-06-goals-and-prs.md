In January I wrote down a few goals that I wanted to reach this year. Among
them were my lifting goals of 225lb bench press, 225lb squat, 315lb deadlift.

Today I pulled 315lb for 3 reps on the deadlift, and 225lb for 5 reps in the
squat. Unfortunately my bench press is lagging way back at 185lb but I'm
hoping that I'll get it to 200lb by the end of the year.

As Meatloaf would say, [2 out of 3 ain't bad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v
=k5hWWe-ts2s).

At a bodyweight of 158.5lb, I reckon those numbers aren't bad. Comparing them
to the [Strength
Standards](http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/StrengthStandards.htm)
puts me firmly in the intermediate range which is about right since I've only
been lifting since mid\-2011. I was surprised to see that it's my squat, not my
bench, that is lagging according to Strength Standards \- it should be around
250lb.

I'm excited to see how much I can push beyond these goals by the end of the
year.
