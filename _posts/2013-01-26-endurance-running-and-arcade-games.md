In old-school arcade games you had no way to save your progress so if you lost
all your men then you had to start from the beginning again. And again. And
again. Until you improved enough to be able to conquer the monster at the end.

It was frustrating but I think that it taught me a valuable lesson.

Each endurance run "starts from the beginning" and I spend a lot of time
getting back to the point where I need improvement - the last few miles. This
continuous repetition helps me become proficient at the first 75% of a
distance, and reminds me that the training doesn't begin until it gets
difficult.

Pushing through the discomfort is what make you stronger.
