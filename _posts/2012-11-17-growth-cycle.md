I started a growth cycle on Oct 1st, three weeks after my epigastric hernia
surgery on Sept 13. The plan was to bulk up for 7 weeks and then do a short 4
week fat-loss cycle before heading home to Australia for Christmas. I want to
be beach-ready when I get there.

Most of the excess calories during the growth cycle came from steel-cut oats.
I was eating about a cup (measured raw) per day, in addition to my regular
meals. I was also fasting on Sundays to minimize fat gain and to reset my
insulin sensitivity.

I lifted heavy on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and did a long run
(20-30km) every Saturday.

At the start of the growth cycle I was 5'10" and 154lb, and today (7 weeks
later) I'm 166lb. I can still kinda see my abs but they're pretty blurry so
it's time to cut the fat.

I'll be on a fat-loss program for the next 5 weeks. The plan is

  * Fasting 2-3 times week.
  * Sprints twice a week.
  * Weights 3 times per week.
