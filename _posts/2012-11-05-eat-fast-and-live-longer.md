I just watched an excellent BBC documentary titled [Eat, Fast and Live
Longer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01lxyzc). Michael Mosley investigates
the health impact of various forms of Intermittent Fasting including a
prolonged 3.5 day fast, alternate day fasting, and 5/2 alternate day fasting.

The science is irrefutable - the health of this 55 year-old man was
dramatically improved through short-term fasting. Lower blood glucose, lower
IGF-1, lower body fat etc. This should significantly reduce his likelihood of
developing cancer, heart disease and diabetes.
