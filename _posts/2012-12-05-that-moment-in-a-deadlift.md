You load up the bar, step back, and stare down at it, thinking, "I'm gonna
lift you". You take a few deep breaths, step forward and adjust your stance,
then bend down and grip the bar.

You straighten your back, apply some tension and then ... GO! But there's a
fraction of a second, just a moment, when nothing happens; the bar doesn't
budge; your veins are popping; and your mind is screaming, "Move, you fucker!"

And then it happens. The bar comes off the floor and slowly moves to lockout.

You drop the bar and feel like a conqueror.

That's why I deadlift.
