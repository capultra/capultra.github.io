The last marathon I ran was the [Toronto
marathon](http://torontomarathon.com/) in 2005, and I finished in [3:57:36](ht
tp://www.sportstats.ca/searchResults.xhtml?month=0&lastname=pardey&year=&first
name=craig&city=toronto). I was shooting for a sub-4 so I was pretty stoked
with that time.

Now, nearly 8 years later I'm excited to be running it again, but I've done a
lot of things differently this time.

I've been running less. A lot less - only once per week. Last time I was
training about 5 days a week and it really felt like a grind towards the end.
The ramp-up was too fast, and I had several injuries throughout the training
program including my knee and lower back. So this time around I decided to mix
strength training and running so I've been lifting weights 3 times a week
concentrating on the big compound movements, and running my long distances on
the weekends. I have been virtually injury free and have not really felt like
the runs were a grind - even those bitterly-cold pre-dawn winter runs.

I'm running "barefoot". Well, in Vibram FiveFingers, anyway. I started
transitioning to a minimalist running style during my preparations for the Las
Vegas Half back in Dec 2011 and ramped up slowly over about 6 months. Now, I
couldn't imagine going back to regular shoes - they just feel so confining.

I'm also carb-loading this time. I dropped 7lb in 10 days on a low-carb diet
(mostly water weight), did a short tempo run on Wednesday morning, and now
I'll be carb-loading [like this](http://greatist.com/fitness/does-carb-
loading-really-work) for the next 3 days. Hopefully it will make the later
stages of the race a little easier.

As usual I have three goal times for the race

  1. Sub 3:45 would be awesome
  2. Sub 3:55 would be good
  3. Sub 4:00 would be satisfactory
  
  
Mostly, I'm interested to see if "less is more" when it comes to training.
