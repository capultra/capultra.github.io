<p>It has now been 2 months since my shoulder injury (a grade 3 AC joint separation).</p>
<p>I am pleased with the progress that I've made to date, but was expecting the pain to have subsided more than it has.<br />

<strong>The Good</strong><br />
I can now do 15 pushups. My squat and deadlift are back to their pre-injury weights, and my bent-over row is improving. Last week I was able to pick up my 35 lb pre-schooler for the first time.</p>
<p>Getting dressed is not painful any more, and I can sleep on my bad side but it does make it stiff the next day.</p>
<p><strong>The Bad</strong><br />
Sudden movements are still very painful (and frequent when there's a 3 year-old to chase after). The other day I slipped on the ice and my arms flailed; the pain nearly brought me to tears.</p>
<p>Dips, pull-ups and chin-ups are still impossible, and I haven't attempted a bench press yet. I can only manage 95lb on the incline bench.</p>
<p><strong>Looking forward</strong><br />
Once I am able to do 40 push-ups then I'll introduce the flat bench into my workout. I'd also like to incorporate a shoulder press pretty soon - pushing overhead is easier than pulling.</p>
