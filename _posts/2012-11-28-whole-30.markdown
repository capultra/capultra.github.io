<p>I just heard about the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;whole9life.com&#47;2012&#47;08&#47;the-whole30-program&#47;">Whole 30<&#47;a> program, and love the approach that this diet recommends.  I particularly love its zero-tolerance for cheating in any form.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>It is not hard.<&#47;b> Don&rsquo;t you <i>dare<&#47;i> tell us this is hard. Quitting heroin is hard. Beating cancer is hard. Drinking your coffee black. Is. Not. Hard.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>This is awesome. Man up and get some perspective on your diet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t even consider the possibility of a &ldquo;slip&rdquo;. Unless you physically tripped and your face landed in a box of doughnuts, there is no &ldquo;slip&rdquo;. You make a choice to eat something unhealthy. It is always a choice, so do not phrase it as if you had an accident...<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>This resonates so deeply for me.  Every item you put in your mouth represents a choice. Take responsibility!</p>
<blockquote><p>You never, ever, ever HAVE to eat anything you don&rsquo;t want to eat<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>If there's nothing available that suits your diet then just skip that meal.  Our ancestors didn't eat 3 squares a day, they ate when food was available.  You're not going to die if you skip a meal or two.</p>
