Strength, stamina, fitness. These are the words that endurance athletes evoke,
but these attributes play a much smaller role than one may think.

Endurance sports are about enduring pain.

It takes many hours of training to build up sufficient strength, stamina and
fitness to be able to complete an event like a marathon or an Iron Man, but
these will only take an athlete so far. Once you can run for an hour or two,
you can run all day _provided you can work through the pain_.

And that's what endurance training is about - facing the agony, defeating it
mentally, and completing the distance. _Beating_ the distance. The training
re-inforces the mindset that _pain is temporary_ and that it will pass (or at
least move to another body part).

As my long runs get longer I spend more and more time in the Pain Cave but
I've learned that pain is a fluid enemy. It attacks in waves but usually
passes in a few miles. Most of my training is focused not on fitness but on
teaching my mind that it can push through these agonising periods. And I get
stronger each time.
